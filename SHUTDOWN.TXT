This program issues a broadcast message to the Desktop frame windows
as WM_SYSCOMMAND, uscmd SC_CLOSE, to BMSG_FRAMEONLY.  Each frame
window issues itself and its client WM_CLOSE.  There is no confirmation
of shutdown from SHUTDOWN itself.  However, running applications are
given the usual desktop shutdown messages and can save files, etc.
before the desktop WinShutdownSystem call is completed.

This is a bare-bones type of program.  If you need confirmation
prior to launching this program, obtain it in the invoking REXX
or program object.
